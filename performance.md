Below is the real, production-grade caching stack you should use right now.

First: understand where caching CAN happen

Since you’re not using SW / IndexedDB, caching happens in 3 places only:

CDN / HTTP caching (BIGGEST WIN)

Browser memory cache

API-level caching (server-side)

You already have the architecture to do all three.

1️⃣ CDN + HTTP Caching (80% of your performance boost)

This is the most important part.

What should be cached?

PDFs

Images

Diagrams

Rhymes

Static AI outputs (once generated)

All of these are read-heavy and rarely change.

How to do it (simple & correct)

When serving files from object storage or CDN, set headers:

Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

What this does

Browser caches the file

Next time → zero network

iOS / Android both respect this

No Service Worker needed

Example

Teacher uploads:

trigonometric-ratios-diagram.png


Student opens it:

First time → network

Second time → instant (memory/disk cache)

If the file changes:

Upload as a new filename

Old cache auto-invalidates

👉 Never overwrite files. Always version them.

2️⃣ Browser memory cache (automatic, free)

When you fetch data like this:

fetch("/api/student/content?topic_id=123");


The browser will:

Cache the response in memory

Reuse it during the same session

How to help it

Set API headers:

Cache-Control: private, max-age=60


This means:

Same screen re-open → instant

Page reload → still fresh for 60s

3️⃣ API-level caching (VERY IMPORTANT FOR DASHBOARDS)

Your heaviest calls will be:

Topic progress

Student dashboard

Teacher coverage reports

These should NOT hit DB every time.

Server-side cache (Redis or in-memory)

Example:

GET /api/class/9A/topic-progress


Cache key:

class:9A:topic-progress


TTL:

30s – 2 min (fine)

Invalidate when:

Teacher updates topic status

Student revision is marked

This alone cuts DB load massively.

4️⃣ AI output caching (huge win)

AI calls are:

Expensive

Slow

Repetitive

Rule

Same input + same context = same output

So:

Hash AI request

Check DB first

Reuse if exists

Example:

Generate 10 questions for Trigonometric Ratios


If already generated:

Return stored ai_output

Skip AI call

Users think it’s “fast AI”.
You saved money.

5️⃣ Frontend-level tricks (React-specific)

Even without SW, React can feel fast.

a) Avoid refetching unnecessarily

Use:

useRef / useMemo

Query libraries (React Query / TanStack Query)

Example:

useQuery({
  queryKey: ["topicProgress", classId],
  queryFn: fetchProgress,
  staleTime: 60000, // 1 min
});


This is client-side memory cache, not IndexedDB.

b) Lazy load heavy stuff

PDFs

Images

Large lists

<img loading="lazy" />

c) Skeleton loaders (UX trick)

Even if request takes 300ms, users perceive speed.

6️⃣ What NOT to cache (important)

❌ Don’t cache:

Auth responses

User profile edits

Writes / mutations

Anything user-specific long-term

These should always be fresh.

7️⃣ Performance checklist (copy this)
Backend

 CDN with long-lived cache for files

 Redis cache for dashboards

 AI output reuse

 DB indexes correct

Frontend

 React Query with staleTime

 Lazy loading

 Avoid refetch loops

 Clear loading states

Final truth (memorize this)

Service Workers are optional.
HTTP caching is not.

If you:

Version files

Set cache headers

Cache dashboards briefly

Reuse AI outputs

Your PWA will feel fast on iOS and Android, even without offline support.
